             <b>Education</b> is the transmission of <i>knowledge, skills, and character traits.</i>
             There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about
             which aims it tries to achieve. A further issue is whether part of the 
             <u>meaning of education</u> is that the change in the student is an improvement. 
             Some researchers stress the <mark>of critical thinking</mark>  to distinguish 
             education from indoctrination. These disagreements affect how to identify, 
             measure, and <em> forms of education</em>. The term can also refer to the
             mental states and qualities of educated people. <del>Additionally, it can mean 
             the academic field studying education</del>. <br>
             Many factors influence whether education is successful. Psychological 
             factors include motivation, intelligence, and personality. Social factors, 
             like socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender, are often linked to 
             discrimination. Further factors include educational technology, teacher 
             quality, and parent involvement. <br>
