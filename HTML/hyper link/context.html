            There are many classifications of education. It depends on the institutional 
            framework whether education is formal, non-formal, or informal. Levels of 
            education are distinguished based on factors like the student's age and the 
            complexity of the content. Some classifications focus on the learner or the topic. 
            Others rely on the teaching method, the medium used, or the funding.
