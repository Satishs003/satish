            Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. 
            There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about 
            which aims it tries to achieve. A further issue is whether part of the 
            meaning of education is that the change in the student is an improvement. 
            Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish 
            education from indoctrination.
