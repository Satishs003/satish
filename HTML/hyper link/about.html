            Many factors influence educational achievement. They include psychological factors, 
            which concern the student as an individual, and sociological factors, which pertain 
            to the student's social environment. Further factors include access to educational 
            technology, teacher quality, and parent involvement. Many of these factors overlap 
            and influence each other.
