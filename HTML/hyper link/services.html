            The main discipline investigating education is called education studies, 
            also referred to as education sciences. It tries to determine how people 
            transmit and acquire knowledge by studying the methods and forms of education. 
            It is interested in its aims, effects, and value as well as the cultural, 
            societal, governmental, and historical contexts that shape education. Education 
            theorists integrate insights from many other fields of inquiry, including philosophy, psychology, sociology.
